# Chef

## 1.	Install chef-client on you VM

## 2.	Create hw26 cookbook. This cookbook should:
      a.	Create file  /root/hw26
      b.	Create dir  /root/hw26
      c.	Create file  /root/hw26_info. File should contain IP address of your host. Do this file as a template.
      d.	Copy file hw26_test_file from you cookbook to /root/hw26_test_file
      e.	Create user hw26
      f.	Install any package you like

# Ansible

###  You can update your previous playbook. You can create hw26 role if needed

## 1.	Create a task with sleep 20.

## 2.	Create another one with wait_for  to wait the result of previous task. If successful print appropriate message

## 3.	Do tasks 1-2 but now task one should be in failed state after sleep

## 4.	How we can check if variable have specific value. If not, fail the play. How to fail task only. Also do it using assert.

## 5.	Create asynchronous ansible task and check it result
